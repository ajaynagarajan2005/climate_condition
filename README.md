# Climate Change Prediction Using AI

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the impact of climate change on global temperatures using machine learning models. The project involves collecting and preprocessing climate data, building machine learning models, training them with historical data, and evaluating their performance. The goal is to provide insights into the future trends of global warming, allowing for informed decision-making on climate action.

## Key Features

- Data collection and cleaning from historical climate data sources.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for temperature prediction.
- Building machine learning models using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Visualizations of results using *matplotlib* and *seaborn* to illustrate temperature predictions over time.

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: The primary programming language for this project.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- *NumPy*: For numerical computations.
- *Scikit-learn*: For machine learning models and evaluations.
- *matplotlib / seaborn*: For data visualization.
- *Google Colab*: For running the project in a cloud-based environment.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project includes historical temperature data from various global locations. You can find the dataset in the data folder within this repository or from publicly available climate data sources such as:

- [NOAA Global Climate Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)
